# Useful Resources

This section provides a list of books and resources that I have found useful in my journey to understand credit risk management and related fields. Don't be overwhelmed by the number of resources listed here. I did not read all of them cover to cover. Instead, I used them as references to solve specific problems or to gain a deeper understanding of a particular topic I encountered in my work.
