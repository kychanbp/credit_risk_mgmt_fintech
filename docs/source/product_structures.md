# Common Product Structures in Consumer Finance

## Consideration of Product Structures

Financial products require a careful balance between business volume (revenue) and risk (cost) from inception, which differs from typical consumer products where business models can be optimized post-launch. Establishing the right product structure is fundamental to credit business sustainability. This is particularly important because financial products have universal appeal when perceived as "free money," yet their structure - including repayment frequency and maturity - directly impacts customers' ability and likelihood to repay. Therefore, thoughtful product design that aligns business objectives with risk management is essential from the start.

When evaluating product structures, I consider the following key dimensions:

- **Use Case and Acquisition Channels (Frontend)**: The primary use case defines both the target user segment and user quality. Understanding this is critical for product positioning.

- **Limit and Limit Type (Backend; Risk Management)**: These parameters determine risk exposure levels and should align closely with the intended use case.

- **Repayment Plan (Backend; Risk Management)**: The maturity period and repayment frequency significantly influence customer repayment behavior and must be carefully structured.

- **Collateral (Backend; Risk Management)**: The presence of collateral or required down payments can effectively mitigate risk exposure.

- **Interest Rate and Fees (Frontend and Backend; Target User and Risk Management)**: Interest rates not only define the target customer segment but also establish the acceptable margin of error for risk management.

## Supplementary Notes on Credit Card Model

### Three-Party vs Four-Party Credit Card Models

The credit card industry operates primarily under two main models: the three-party model (closed loop) and the four-party model (open loop).

#### Three-Party Model (Closed Loop)

In a three-party model, the key parties are:

1. The cardholder (consumer)
2. The merchant
3. The card issuer/network (single entity)

Examples include American Express and Discover, where the company acts as both the card issuer and payment network. Key characteristics:

- Direct relationships with both cardholders and merchants
- Full control over fees and terms
- Typically higher merchant fees but also higher cardholder rewards
- More integrated customer experience
- Limited acceptance compared to four-party networks

#### Four-Party Model (Open Loop)

In a four-party model, the participants are:

1. The cardholder (consumer)
2. The merchant
3. The issuing bank
4. The acquiring bank/payment network

Examples include Visa and Mastercard networks. Key characteristics:

- Broader merchant acceptance
- Shared revenue and risks among participants
- More complex fee structure
- Greater competition among issuers
- Network effects benefit all participants
