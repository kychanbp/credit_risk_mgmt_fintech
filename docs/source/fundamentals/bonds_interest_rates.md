# Fundamentals of Interest Rates (WIP)

## TL;DR

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered why there exists an interest rate for a loan? Why do we need to pay interest on borrowed money? (Can interest rates be negative?) In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of interest rates and their relationship with the consumer credit industry.

## The Impatience Theory of Interest

> By definition, the rate of interest is the price of capital in terms of income, when both capital and income are measured in terms of the same unit, as, for instance, of money; or, what amounts to the same thing, the rate of interest is the excess above par which has to be paid for this year's money in terms of next year's money. - Irving Fisher [^1]

The English is a bit archaic. Irving Fisher explains the connection between, capital, income, time, and rate of interest. "the rate of interest is the price of capital in terms of income" means that interest rate reflects how much income (or return) you can expect to receive from your capital (or investment). "measured in terms of the same unit" means that both capital and income are measured in the same unit, for example, money/dollars. "the rate of interest is the excess above par which has to be paid for this year's money in terms of next year's money" means that interest rate is the premium you have to pay to obtain money today in exchange for repaying money in the future.

The key questions to be answered are:
- Why should there be an excess? Or Why is there a rate of interest?
- What principals determine the amount of this excess?

### Theories

There are number of theories that attempt to explain the rate of interest. I found the impactience theory of interest to be the most convincing (*Again, I am not an economist who follows interest rate theories closely.*). For example, one of the theories is that the rate of interest depends on the amount of money in circulation. The more money in circulation, the lower the interest rate. The less money in circulation, the higher the interest rate. However, plentiful of money raises demand of loan just as much as it raises supply. The "feeling" probably comes from the observation that if bank reserve is low, bank will raise the interest rate to pretect the reserve. But, this is just relative scarcity from the bank's perspective, not an absolute scarcity. Another theory is that interest is due to productivity of capital--because 5% is what investments pay. But why the capital worths a price at the first place? It is simply discounting the future income, and during the process, we need to assume a rate of interest. It is a tautology. Agio Theory states that most of us prefer present goods over future goods of like kind and number, due to "technical superiority of present over future goods" (Production is round-about, meaning it takes time. The same amount of input can yield a greater output in the future.), people having a natural perference for satisfying their needs and desires sonner rather than latter, and uncertainty of the future. However, planting an apple tree today will yield the same/ rougly the same amount of apples in a year latter.
