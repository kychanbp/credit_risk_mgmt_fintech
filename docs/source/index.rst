Welcome to This Training Material for Credit Risk Policy Development!
=====================================================================

This training material is designed to provide a foundational understanding of the key philosophies and methodologies behind credit risk policy development. It is ideal for newcomers to the field of credit risk management seeking to learn the basics, as well as for professionals already working in the field who wish to refresh their knowledge. Additionally, it serves as a valuable resource for trainers who aim to teach credit risk management to others.

The motivation behind this training material stems from my personal struggle to find a comprehensive and easy-to-understand resource when I first entered the field of credit risk management. As our team grows, it becomes increasingly important to pass on knowledge to new members in a structured and effective manner. This material also aims to foster a culture of knowledge sharing, which I believe is crucial for the success of any organization. 

I publish this material publicly to ensure it is general and applicable to a wider audience, as it contains no sensitive or specific information about the companies I have worked for or am currently working for. This approach also invites feedback and improvement from the community.

    "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets." (Matthew 7:12, NIV)
